# Shrink Compressor

 This is a video compressor for android using jetpack compose for the UI design. It uses the [light Compressor API](https://github.com/AbedElazizShe/LightCompressor) for fast 
 and efficient video compression. The app also supports lossless video compression but you can also modify the videoWidth and videoHeight for
 different qualities.
